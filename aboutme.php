			<h2>My Dream</h2>


			<p>The late Roger Ebert, a brilliant critic, once said that

			<q cite='http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art'>
				<a href='http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art'>
					"video games can never be art"
				</a>
			</q>.

					"...no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists and composers"
				</a>
			</q>,

			</p>

			<p>
			<strong>It is my dream to change that.</strong>
