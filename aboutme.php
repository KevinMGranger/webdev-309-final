		<h2>My Dream</h2>


		<p>The late Roger Ebert, a brilliant critic, once said that

		<q cite='http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art'><a href='http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art'>video games can never be art</a></q>.

		He later <a href='http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art'>changed his position</a>, but his words still opened up a great debate on the topic.
		</p>


		<p>While I will mostly agree in his assertion that

		<q cite='http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-genders'><a href='http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-genders'>...no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists and composers</a></q>,

		I think that games as art are
		<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9y6MYDSAww'>still in their infancy</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		<strong>It is my dream to change that.</strong>

		<h2>Schooling</h2>
		<p>I am a third-year student at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Game Design and Development.</p>
		<p>I am also a former Physics major. As much as I still love physics, I realized that my passion lied elsewhere.</p>
		<p>At least I still have a love for things on the technical side.</p>

		<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p>When I manage to find some free time (never), I also have some assorted interests:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). Free as in Speech, not as in Beer. I love the concept of collaborative problem solving through technology, and the sharing of practical work.</li>
			<li>GNU/Linux. I love using being able to customize almost every aspect of my operating system, and the idea that it's free (in both senses of the word).</li>
			<li>Gaming. A Game Design major who likes to play games, imagine that?</li>
			<li>The Great Outdoors. Camping, hiking, swimming, sailing. Once a Boy Scout, always a Boy Scout. You can't spend all of your time in front of a computer, can you?</li>
		</ul>
